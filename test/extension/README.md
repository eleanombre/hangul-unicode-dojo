## Extension!
### Congratulations on completing the task 🎉👏

The extension is to adapt your code so that it will solve not just syllable blocks (eg ㅎ,ㅏ,ㄴ -> 한) but word blocks (eg ㅎ,ㅏ,ㄴ,ㄱ,ㅜ,ㄱ,ㅇ,ㅓ -> 한국어)

Your input will be an array of 9 strings:

`['ㅉ','ㅣ','ㅁ','ㅈ','ㅣ','ㄹ','ㅂ','ㅏ','ㅇ']`

and your expected output is the combination of all 9 in a string form:

`찜질방`

When you've finished with your TDD and code you can run the final test suite by typing:

`npm run test:extension`
